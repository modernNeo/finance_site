## Things to implement
 - Setup DB on the_machine
 - be able to handle expenses where somneone else paid for me 
   - mostly handled, just have to add a flag or clear indicator when they have not paid me back yet 
 - be able to handle Household Necessities where I paid with either MasterCard or Debit and still be able to easily determine how much I have to pay for MasterCard
   - I think this is done
 - handle when someone [Mirchero or Vena] pays for part of my transaction
   - think this is handled
 - keep track of which reimbursements have to go to Regular Savings and which Reimbursements have to go to Credit Card Payment
 - upload pictures of receipts
 - be able to break up a transaction into multiple items [like if I am getting a reimbursement and income in same deposit]
